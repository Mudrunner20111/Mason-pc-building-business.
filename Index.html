🚀 Custom PC Builds & Upgrades – Local, Personalized Service 🚀

Passionate about PCs? So am I! As a 13-year-old entrepreneur, I run a local PC building business dedicated to helping gamers, content creators, and professionals get the best custom-built PCs, upgrades, and full setups—without the hassle!

👾 What I Offer:

Custom PC Builds (High-End & Budget Builds): Whether you're building a gaming powerhouse, a content creation rig, a workstation, or a budget-friendly setup, I’ll help you select the best components that match your performance needs and budget. I will assemble and test everything to ensure stability, reliability, and high performance.
Build Fee:

$100 – Full assembly, testing, and optimization of your custom PC.
$50 upfront deposit for high-end builds – Since premium builds require more time, complex assembly, and extra optimization, a $50 deposit is required before I start. This deposit goes toward the total $100 build fee (so you’ll only pay the remaining $50 upon completion).
Full Setup (PC + Peripherals) – $110: Get your entire PC and peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.) set up and optimized, so you can plug in and start using your system immediately!
PC Upgrades: If your current system is in need of an upgrade, I’ll help with components like GPU, CPU, RAM, storage, or cooling to bring your setup up to date. You’ll need to bring your PC to me for the upgrade process, and I’ll handle all the technical work to ensure everything runs smoothly.
Upgrade Fee: $40 for upgrading your current PC, including installation, testing, and optimization of the new components.
PC Specifications for $15: Unsure what parts to get? I’ll spec out a custom PC for you for just $15! I’ll give you a complete list of recommended parts based on your specific needs and budget, with a rough price estimate for the build. I’ll also guide you on where to order the parts at the best prices to make sure you get the best deals!
Used Parts Builds & Upgrades: If you want to use second-hand or refurbished parts, I can build or upgrade your PC with used parts that you provide. You will be responsible for finding and purchasing the parts, and I’ll handle the assembly and testing to make sure everything works properly.
Cooling Options: Choose between AIO (All-in-One) liquid cooling or air cooling depending on your needs:
AIO Cooling: High-performance, sleek, and efficient cooling solution for demanding systems.
Air Cooling: A more budget-friendly, reliable option that provides great airflow.
Expert Consultation: I’ll guide you through selecting the right parts to match your budget and performance goals. I’ll make sure everything works seamlessly together to deliver the best possible experience.
Thorough Testing & Optimization: Before you pick up your PC, I’ll run full stability tests, optimize settings, and make sure everything is performing at its peak. You’ll get a system that’s 100% ready to use!
Boxes & Packaging: Once the build or upgrade is complete, I’ll give you all the original boxes and packaging for the parts used in your system, so you have everything in case of warranty issues or future upgrades.
Shipping Parts: Some retailers allow parts to be shipped directly to me, making the process easier for you. I’ll let you know if this is an option based on where you order from!

⚠️ What I Don’t Offer:

Finding Used Parts for You: If you want to use second-hand parts, you’ll need to source them yourself—I don’t track down used components for customers. However, I can help you determine what used parts would be compatible with your build.
Open-loop water cooling systems: I specialize in AIO cooling—simple, effective, and easy to maintain.
Overclocking: My focus is on creating stable, reliable systems without the risks of pushing components beyond their limits.
💡 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):

Q: Can you recommend parts for my build?
Yes! I offer a PC specification service for $15, where I’ll create a full parts list based on your needs and budget.
Q: Can I order parts and have them shipped to you?
Sometimes! Some retailers allow direct shipping to me, and I’ll let you know if that’s an option.
Q: How long does a build or upgrade take?
Most builds are completed within 1–3 days, depending on complexity and part availability.
✅ 7-Day Build Guarantee
I stand by my work! If you experience any setup or hardware-related issues within 7 days of pickup, I’ll check your system and fix any build-related problems for free. This guarantee ensures you get a fully functional, stable PC without any extra hassle.

🔧 Please Note:

You’ll need to provide your own parts. I can help you select the best components for your build or upgrade, but you’ll need to purchase them beforehand. If you’re not sure where to buy them, I can tell you the best places to order based on pricing, availability, and reliability. Once you have the parts, I’ll take care of assembly, installation, testing, and optimization. In some cases, parts can be shipped directly to me.
Pickup only: For now, I’m offering pickup-only service. Once your build or upgrade is ready, you can pick up your system directly from me. No shipping involved!
Upgrades: For upgrades, you must bring your PC to me in person. I’ll take care of the rest once it’s here!
As a 13-year-old business owner, I may be young, but I’m committed to providing a high-quality, professional service. You won’t deal with middlemen—just me working directly with you to ensure everything is done to your satisfaction. I’m passionate about PCs and I’ll always give you my best!
